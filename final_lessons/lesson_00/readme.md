# Lesson 0
2. Intended for students of an AP CS A class.
3. Lesson 00 will be day 2 of arrays. On day 1 of arrays, we will have introduced and done proof-of-concept exit tickets for accessing indexes in arrays, initializing arrays, and doing simple for loops of arrays. students only need to be comfortable accessing elements in the array. the lesson will be a lab where we implement a caesar cipher using an array of letters.
methods i'll use for lesson 00:
live coding
scaffolding
I think the program complexity will still be relatively low, so I think each student should be doing their own coding. live coding will be demoing the modulo operator and reviewing accessing strings using charAt OR making a String[] array of one-letter Strings and accessing that array. (ed
