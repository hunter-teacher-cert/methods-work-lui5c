# Lesson 0
2. Intended for students of an AP CS A class.
3. Lesson 00 will be day 2 of arrays. On day 1 of arrays, we will have introduced and done proof-of-concept exit tickets for accessing indexes in arrays, initializing arrays, and doing simple for loops of arrays. students only need to be comfortable accessing elements in the array. the lesson will be a lab where we implement a caesar cipher using an array of letters.
methods i'll use for lesson 00:
live coding
scaffolding
I think the program complexity will still be relatively low, so I think each student should be doing their own coding. live coding will be demoing the modulo operator and reviewing accessing strings using charAt OR making a String[] array of one-letter Strings and accessing that array.

## Learning Goal
SWBAT confidently navigate 0-based indexing to reference, manipulate, and create their own strings. 
SWBAT apply their understandings of the Caesar cipher and String indexing to create a program
that encrypts plaintexts under a customizable Caesar cipher.


### Small warm-up activity
Students will be asked to create a program that takes a String, <code>plaintext</code>, and prints each character on its own line.
