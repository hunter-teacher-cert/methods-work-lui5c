## Lesson Plan assignment

#### DUE  Tuesday, 8/1 10:00am EDT

Students are to create two detailed lesson plans, with supporting materials for computer science lessons. The plans should be novel, and wholly written by yourself. But you will be giving time to discuss your plans with your classmates and incorperate their feedback if desired. Each lesson plan should demonstrate different pedogogical techniques presented during the course. For reference, here is a list of the specific methods topics covered this semester. You are not limited to these, but you should use at least 4 of them between your 2 lessons:

- Pair Programming
- Live Coding
- Trace Diagrams
- CS Unplugged
- Scaffolding
- Webpage Portfolio
- Gallery Walk
- Debugging
- Group Work
- Community Building

The plans can be sequential, or entirely separate. The completed assignment should be such that the two lesson plans can be given to any computer science teacher and they could deliver the lessons as intended. For example, if the lesson includes subgoal labeling, the project should include the finished desired code along with the subgoal labels included within.

### Required Content
Each lesson should have:

- A clearly stated learning goal.
- A small warm up activity.
- Some amount of teacher delivered content.
  - This could take differnet forms i.e. notes/diagrams to write on the board, slides, annoted live code, skeleton files with explantions, etc.
  - At least one lesson should have teacher delievered content that involves a class-wide discussion (e.g. code tracing or diagramming together, live coding with stops for student facing questions and predictions, etc.)
- Student centered activity
  - At least one lesson should have a collaborative activity.

In addition, students will inlcude a description of the intended student audience and course, a list of the methods used, and a detailed explanation of why those methods were chosen.

### Submission Instructions
Create a directory in  your repository called `final_lessons`. In that directory create 2 more directories named `lesson00` and `lesson01`. Put all your lesson materials in these directories. The directories should contain actual files, not links to google drive, replit, etc. The folders should include (but not limited to):

* A __README.md__ file that includes the meta-analysis of the lesson.
    - This is where you can provide background about the student audience, course, and analysis of your chosen methods.
* All teacher-facing documentation.
* Any slides (if applicable).
* All student-provided materials (handouts, etc).
* All source code (if applicable).
* Potential solutions to assignments (if applicable).

__ALSO__ Create a single pdf that contains everything needed for the lesson, call it `lesson00.pdf` and `lesson01.pdf`. The guiding principle is that someone with that pdf would have everything they need for the lesson.

### Lesson Plan Rubric

| Element | D | C | B | A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Clear objective | Lesson objective is not  stated and unclear. | Lesson objective is stated, but materials do not clearly support objective | Lesson objective is clear from the supporting materials. | Lesson objective is stated and clearly supported by materials. |
| Meta-analysis   | Analysis is missing for both lessons  | Analysis for one lesson is present with explanations for some chosen methods.  | Analysis for both lessons is present with explanations for some chosen methods.  | Analysis for both lessons is present with thoughtful explanations for all chosen methods.   |
| Use of technique 1   | Technique is poorly chosen and applied to the lesson objective.  | Technique is well chosen but not applied well, or technique is poorly chosen but applied well  | Technique is well chosen and well delivered.  | Technique is well chosen, well delivered and rationale is clear. |
| Use of technique 2   | Technique is poorly chosen and applied to the lesson objective.  | Technique is well chosen but not applied well, or technique is poorly chosen but applied well  | Technique is well chosen and well delivered.  | Technique is well chosen, well delivered and rationale is clear. |
| Supporting materials   | Supporting materials are missing.  | Supporting materials are incomplete.  | Supporting materials are present.  | Supporting materials are present and directly referenced in lesson plan. |

Failure to follow submission guidelines may result in a grade deduction.
