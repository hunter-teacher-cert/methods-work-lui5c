# Pair Programming Framework
### Rally Racing

The Rally Racing framework of understanding and representing pair programming will be how I present pair programming. I think it represents the asymmetry and mutual benefits of pair programming accurately, and will be easy for students to find silly. Students have a laser eye for authenticity, and I actually think rally racing is cool. At the very least, they'll believe my excitement when we talk about pair programming like rally racing. 

The metaphor of driver for typer works, because they have to have strong __motor__ skills and type quickly enough to keep up with the copilot's instructions. They're not necessarily coming up with the ideas for what they're writing, which is also accurate to rally racing - the idea of where and how aggresively to take a turn comes entirely from the copilot's instructions/suggestions. 

I think that pair programming will only really embraced if there is a realism in the way that the driver is talked about - I don't think that all students will be perfect drivers, who don't write things of their own. I think that a lot will be, though. I think a lot of students will be earnest copilots. Some students will *really* want to be driver and resent being copilot. As the teacher, I'll pace, making sure that drivers aren't driving *too* much without the copilot, and that copilots aren't letting drivers do all the work. I'll also make sure that there is a clear, firm, fair, and impartial halfway point for drivers and copilots to switch. 

The framework of rally racing for thinking of pair programming will work weakest with students who want to write code but don't feel confident enough in their understanding of the topic material to take pride in their ability to give directions. There is a lot of potential embarassment in revealing to another student that you don't understand the subject matter, and it would only work positively if a lot of trust and respect and kindness existed between the meeting-expectations driver and the approaching-expectations copilot.

As with anything, it will depend on the class. I don't think pair programming is the only way to teach any certain topic, and I don't think Rally Racing is the only key to winning students over to believing in pair programming. If a class flatly rejects my rally racing analogy, I will change my ways to best teach them.

Questions to consider when working on your framework:
0. How does it separate the two roles of PP?
1. How approachable/interesting/exciting is it?
2. Why do you think it will get students to buy into the process?
3. What aspects of PP is the framework strongest in?
4. What areas are this frameworkâ€™s weaknesses?
