Game day!

#### How It Works
Happens either very two weeks or every Friday, depending on pacing. I find a way to create a review game
of the topics that we've been learning and format them to be compatible with an online
game. I separate students into random teams every time.

#### Expected Positive Outcomes
Motivation of students through playful competition, fun games, rewarding skills that aren't directly
related to content or prior experience.

#### Rollout Timeline
The only hard part is getting students to learn the games that you'll be playing. Once they know how to play buy-in is easier.

#### Mechanism for Gauging Efficacy
If students are excited for it to be game day and can answer the questions correctly without too much teacher intervention. 

#### Expected Hurdles and Plans to Overcome
Student emotional regulation - depends on the students/classroom environment. The environment will have to be supportive and playful rather than cutthroat and competitive.
