# swap() and getSmallestIndexBetweenXandY()

from the code:


### There are 2 parts to this assignment: 
#### 1. swap 
this function should swap the elements at indexes a and b of myArray.
```
int[] myArray = new int[]{25, 2, 18, 9};
swap(myArray, 0, 1);
System.out.println(myArray);
            => "[2, 25, 18, 9]"
```

Hint: you will proabably need a temporary variable.

Hint #2: you should be able to do this with 3 lines of code.
                    every line should have an equals sign. 

#### getSmallestIndexBetweenXandY
this method searches for the smallest element between indices x and y (including x but not including y) and returns the index of that smallest element.

inputs: int[] array, int x, int y
x is the lower bound of the search (inclusive)
y is the upper bound of the search (exclusive)
array is the array that you're searching in

 example:
 int[] myArray = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 int j = getSmallestIndexBetweenXandY(myArray, 2, 5);
 System.out.println(j);
 => "3"
