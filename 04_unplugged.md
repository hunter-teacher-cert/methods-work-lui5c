# CS Uplugged Activity - Blast From The Past? More Like Blast Through The Sorted List To The Index Of What You're Searching For

(40-60 min activity)

### Materials
set of 16 cards for each group. Cards contain any number between 0 and 100. 
alternatively, can use this website: [binary search](https://binary-search.luiscollado1.repl.co/)


### Beginning of class (5 mins)
Students sit in groups of 3 - 4, depending on the size of the class. Each group gets a set of cards.
One person in each group is designated the flip counter. The flip counter makes sure that students don't cheat on the activity by checking what is under each card without fully flipping it. 

### Activity 1
unsorted array search
Ask students to find a number (or the closest number to it) in their deck. The flip counter keeps track of how many flips it takes to find their target number.

### check in - how many flips/checks

### Activity 2
sorted array search

### check in - how many flips/checks? can we do better?
Show students a video on binary search and how it can be used to efficiently search for a member of a sorted collection. 
Make sure students understand the importance of the collection being sorted for binary search to be able to work. 

### Activity 2 again, with more caution
Students find the number (or the closest number to it) in their deck, and upon finding their answer, stand by their desk with the flipped cards displayed. Eventually, the amount of cards required to be "checked" in order for the number to be found by each student should converge to log2(16). 

### Group Lesson
Afterwards, the class comes together and tries to take the binary search they just did and create a codified algorithm out of it.


### Extra time
Students see how many flip to get to a name in the PHONE BOOK it takes.
